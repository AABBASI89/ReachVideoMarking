XX Better support for multiple reach attempts
	Copy the method for selecting bad trials (visualizeTrialData.m)
	Keypress handler is vid_fig_hand_fig_WindowKeyPressFcn.m

Sepparate records at set methods for reach, touch, and retract
	Copy the current method for reach
	Purple Box is RowEditHd, line 281, lable: Trial
	Mint Green Box is RowEditHdRCHONSET, line 298, lable: Reach Onset
	Cyan Box is RowEditHdTRLOUTCOME, line 307, lable: Trial Outcome

Mouse-driven trajectory tracking between final reach and touch
	When does a reach end when there is no touch?
		Make another data field for Reach Offset
		Create way for User to delete trajectory markers
		Do not track trajectory in trials with no touch
		How has this been determined before (assuming we've done it before)?

X change '0' hotkey to something else
indicate that trajectory was saved in 4th column (just a '[saved]' tag is fine)
X full trajectory mark with automatic progression through the sequence
make warning make sounds and display on GUI
prevent editing table and delete previous entry and sort by trial when repeat trial is logged? Do this and the sorting when trial logged
Load trajectory points when returning to a previously logged trial



Do we allow touch but no retract? r/n: yes
Do we allow retract but no touch? r/n: no
Do we allow the tracjectory marking to be bypassed? r/n: no for now
Do we display the warning on the GUI? r/n: no but make it yes
	If yes, when do we remove the warning? You can remove it at a convient point but try to pull focus to the textbox so that the user can see repeated errors grab focus
